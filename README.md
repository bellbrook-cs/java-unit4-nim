# Nim Project

## Problem Statement

In the game of nim two players compete to be the last one to grab all remaining matches from a set of piles.

To start the game, three heaps of matches are made:

- Heap A: 3 matches
- Heap B: 4 matches
- Heap C: 5 matches

Each player alternates turns grabbing any amount of matches from 1 heap. They may not mix and match matches from different heaps.

The game ends when a player successfully takes the last match, and leaves the opponent unable to take a match.

Another version of the game exists where the last player to take a match loses as well. Either version of the game is a valid submission for this project.

### An example game

| Heap A | Heap B | Heap C | Move |
| - | - | - | - |
| 3 | 4 | 5 | Game begins |
| 1 | 4 | 5 | Bob takes 2 from A |
| 1 | 4 | 2 | Alice takes 3 from C |
| 1 | 3 | 2 | Bob takes 1 from B |
| 1 | 2 | 2 | Alice takes 1 from B |
| 0 | 2 | 2 | Bob takes entire A heap, leaving two 2s |
| 0 | 1 | 2 | Alice takes 1 from B |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | Bob takes 1 from C leaving two 1s. (In mis√®re play he would take 2 from C leaving (0, 1, 0).) |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | Alice takes 1 from B |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | Bob takes entire C heap and wins |

### Requirements

- Your game must be a proper implementation of the game of nim.
- You must user proof any player input. 
    - if the user enters something invalid, tell them it was not valid and prompt them again.
- You must display the current state of the game before any player takes a turn.

You may add the additional features as bonus:

- Allow the user to play again without re running the program. (to earn this point, you must ask the player if they want to play again, not just loop forever)
- Allow the user(s) to select custom values for each of the heaps before playing.
- Allow the user(s) to select a game mode (normal or misere play)

## Input Description

You are defining the input and output yourself. Please include a description of your controls.

## Sample Input/Output

You are defining the input and output of the game. There is no defined input and output, however, the following is just ***one example*** of a working game.

```
Welcome to the game of Nim!

Currently the heaps are as follows:

   Heap A: | | |
   Heap B: | | | |
   Heap C: | | | | |
   
Player 1, which heap would you like to take from? A
How much? 2

Currently the heaps are as follows:

   Heap A: |
   Heap B: | | | |
   Heap C: | | | | |
   
Player 2, which heap would you like to take from? C
How much? 6

That is not a valid move!

Player 2, which heap would you like to take from? C
How much? 5

Currently the heaps are as follows:

   Heap A: |
   Heap B: | | | |
   Heap C:
   
Player 1, which heap would you like to take from? D

That is not a valid move!

Player 1, which heap would you like to take from? B
How much? 3

Currently the heaps are as follows:

   Heap A: |
   Heap B: |
   Heap C:
   
Player 2, which heap would you like to take from? A
How much? 0

That is not a valid move!

Player 2, which heap would you like to take from? A
How much? 1

Currently the heaps are as follows:

   Heap A:
   Heap B: |
   Heap C:

Player 1, which heap would you like to take from? B
How much? 1

Currently the heaps are as follows:

   Heap A:
   Heap B: |
   Heap C:

Congrats Player 1! You won!
